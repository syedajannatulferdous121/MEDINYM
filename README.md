# MEDINYM
MEDINYM aims to anonymize speaker identities at voice, statement, and semantic levels without compromising emotional or diagnostic content, paving the way for secure data applications.

# Instructions 
Download all the files except app.py and except.py (they are samples).  
In this project there are two main python files. One for finding outlier document (outlier_doc.py) and another one for finding outlier word (outlier_word.py). At first it’s important to run python files in backend. For that run the file ‘run.sh’.
Then open index.html file to see web development.
